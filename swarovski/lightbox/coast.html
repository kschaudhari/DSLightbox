<p>There's nothing like a trip to the sea to blow the cobwebs away. From white sand beaches to jaw-dropping coastlines and magical bays, take to the sea at one of these five coastal escapes.</p>
<p>There is something mesmerising about the relentless coming and going of the tide. The sound of waves is infinitely soothing and a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle. Here are our five favourite coastlines around the world to escape to.</p>
<h4><strong>GOWER PENINSULA, WALES </strong></h4>
<p>This peninsula in Wales is home to some of the most beautiful beaches in Britain and, unlike their counterparts in Cornwall, they are invariably empty. It’s easy to see why Wales’s national poet, Dylan Thomas, used to escape here when he got tired of life in his hometown of Swansea.</p>
<p>Three Cliffs Bay on the south coast of the peninsula, so named because of the trio of limestone pinnacles that jut out into the sand, is a particular favourite. There’s a bench perched high on a facing cliff which affords magnificent views of the spectacle.</p>
<p>Further along the coast you’ll reach the promontory of Worm’s Head, where Dylan Thomas got cut off by the tide on at least one occasion, and neighbouring Rhossili Bay, which has its own shipwreck and is frequently lauded as the most beautiful beach in Britain.</p>

<h4><strong>LAKE SAIMAA, FINLAND</strong></h4>
<p>Finland’s Lake Saimaa is an archipelago dotted with thousands of islands, which was formed at the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p>Boats are as common as cars here, and there is no end of islets and coves to discover. There are plenty of tour operators that can organise <u><a href="http://www.visitsaimaa.fi/" target="_blank">boat trips</a></u> or for more freedom you can <a href="http://www.saimaaboating.fi/en/boat-rentals" target="_blank">hire your own boat</a>.</p>
<p>The best time to visit is during the annual Midsummer Festival, each June, when the harsh, dark Finnish winters are a distant memory and the 24-hour daylight prompts many lively festivities.</p>

<h4><strong>HA LONG BAY, VIETNAM</strong></h4>
<p>Ha Long Bay translates as ‘descending dragon bay’, so-named because local legend has it that this water world of 1,600 islands and pinnacles was created when a dragon came down from the mountains and plunged towards the sea, its tail causing crevices in its wake.</p>
<p>Today, Ha Long Bay and its waters abound with hidden islets and bays and grottoes that are perfect for taking in the antiquity of your surroundings. The limestone that makes up its pinnacles (dragon or no dragon) have formed over a period of around 500 million years. Yes, that’s 500 million years.</p>
<p>This region is only accessible by boat, so the best way to experience it is by booking a tour on which you can sleep overnight on a boat in the bay.</p>
<p>Waking up to the sound of the water gently lapping your boat while the sky and islands come softly into focus promises to be an unforgettable experience.</p>

<h4><strong>THE DALMATION COAST, CROATIA</strong></h4>
<p>Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast is home to ancient villages and historic cities as well as wild pebble beaches framed by olive trees that creep down to the clear waters of the Adriatic. From there, you can access one of the many off-lying islands.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching of its coastal towns and cities is surely Dubrovnik, the best-preserved medieval walled city in the Mediterranean. Irish writer George Bernard Shaw famously said, “Those who seek paradise on earth should come to Dubrovnik.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he was enticed by the warm Mediterranean climate, the fresh seafood and simple home cooking, or the seemingly endless number of islands that lie off the Dalmatian Coast. Ride the cable car to get an aerial view of the green islands, red roofs and white rocky landscape (bring <u><a href="http://swarovs.ki/CysD" target="_blank">binoculars</a></u> to get a closer view).</p>
<p>Whatever his reasoning, we agree with his sentiment,; we’d add that you should visit during the annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival, when the town comes alive with music, theatre and dance.</p>

<h4><strong>RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL</strong></h4>
<p>There are few more vibrant beach cities than Rio, where the statue of Christ the Redeemer looms down from Sugar Loaf Mountain on the lively scenes below, where strutting beachgoers cool down with a caipirinha or two on Copacabana Beach and nearby Ipanema.</p>
<p>However, while Cariocas (the nickname of Rio’s inhabitants) are certainly sun-worshippers, it’s come sundown that the party really gets going.</p>
<p>The best time to visit this spirited seaside city is in the run-up to the world-famous carnival, which takes place just before Lent every year.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to it, impulsive samba street parties take place under viaducts, on streets, indeed anywhere that the mood takes people, right up to the event itself, when the city becomes a sea of colour and festivities.</p>
