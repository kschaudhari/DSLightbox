    <h4><strong>COORING NATIONAL PARK, AUSTRALIA</strong></h4>
    <p>Coorong National Park, (an hour’s drive south east of Adelaide on the Limestone Coast) is Considered by many to be one of the most important water bird habitats in Australia. The Coorong acts as a magnet to huge numbers of birds with its shallow lagoons protected from the Southern Ocean by a line of sand dunes. </p>
    <p>The 230 bird species found in the Coorong include Little Pied, Little Black and Black-faced Cormorants, Pied Oystercatcher, Australasian and Hoary-headed Grebe, Crested and Fairy tern, myriad migratory waders in the summer months as well as the world’s largest breeding colony of Australian Pelicans.
    The wetlands and lagoons of the Murray River also teem with birdlife, with black swans, Herons and egrets and many species of duck thriving in the shallow waters and river reeds.
    </p>
    <p>South Australia, also boasts an impressive list of seabirds including 12 species of Albatross, 6 species of Prion, 7 species of Gadfly (Pterodroma) Petrel including Great-winged, Mottled, Gould’s, Kerguelen, Soft-Plumaged and White-headed as well as several species of Storm Petrel and Diving Petrel.</p>

    <h4><strong>SAMARIA NATIONAL PARK AND THE WHITE MOUNTAINS, GREECE</strong></h4>
    <p>Head to West Crete for Samaria National Park and the White Mountains, where you can trek the Samaria Gorge; the longest and most famous trekking gorge in Europe. The gorge became a national park in 1962, a refuge for the rare and mythically renowned, kri-kri, the Cretan wild goat. If you are lucky, you may spot them scuttling over the rocky trails. Turn your gaze skyward for rare bird species of vulture and eagle.
    The path from Xyloskalo to the riverbed offers some of the most spectacular views in Greece.
    </p>
    <p>The gorge is open to the public between May and October, following the winter rains. Follow the recently opened Menalon Trail, a winding mountain trail in Arcadia that loops through the Lousios River gorge, Mount Menalo and the Northeast Gortynian Mountains.
    There’s a strong possibility that you could discover ancient archeological treasures if you go diving in Greece; Sithonia in Halkidiki is one of the best spots for multicoloured marine life.
    Hop in a boat with a guide to Melissani Cave – aka the Cave of the Nymphs – close to Karavomilo. Part of the cave’s roof has collapsed, providing an amazing skylight above the crystalline waters of the lake below.
    Spend a day trekking in Mount Ainos National Park, the only national park set on a Greek island.
    Sail around the rocky Argo-Saronic islands, close to the mainland. Cast anchor at fertile Égina for a handful or two of the island’s famous pistachios, plucked from local pistachio orchards, or laze around for a few days on tiny Angistri.

    <h4><strong>PUNGGOL WATERWAY PARK, SINGAPORE</strong></h4>
    <p>Located in the north-eastern corner of Singapore, Punggol Waterway Park is most famous in the Garden City for the sunrise from Sunrise Bridge and is one of the very best views in all of Singapore. </p>
    <p>The 12-hectare park is split into four themed zones – Nature Cove, Recreation Zone, Heritage Zone and the Green Gallery. You can relax at the Nature Zone and enjoy scenic views of the waterway; the Recreation Zone offers lots of water and sand play for the kids as well as a fitness corner; mature trees and vegetation take up the Heritage Zone and in the Green Gallery, you’ll find conservation projects as well as more of the flora and fauna Singapore is famous for.
    The Northern Eastern Riverine Loop is a 26-km cycling trail that mixes exercise, stunning scenery, undulating terrain and great pit stops and if you’re in the park at night the Punggol Promenade Riverside Walk is lit up with fibre-optic lights and is a sight to see.
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly, ‘Punggol’ is a Malay word meaning ‘hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the ground’, a reference to the area’s history as a fruit-growing district.</p>
