                                            There is nothing in sport quite like the Ashes, with its epic history – with its mythical mix of friendship and enmity between the two protagonists, England and Australia; 376 Test matches, over 69 series, across 140 years; its brilliant players; its unique trophy – the charred remains of a bail, housed in a terracotta urn; the alien weather and conditions for touring sides; its five, six or even seven-Test series.

                                            England embark this winter on what, so often for them, has been their toughest tour. Since Ivo Bligh regained the ‘Ashes’ in 1882/83, English tourists have found the experience exciting and all-consuming in equal measure.
                                            <br />
                                            The Test matches in Perth and Adelaide have offered a similar mix. Beauty, joy, intensity, heartache. The Adelaide Oval, venue for this winter’s second Test from December 2-6, was a sublime, poetic cricket venue. With its grass viewing areas, old scoreboard and the Don Bradman Pavilion, there were fears that any modernisation would ruin the beauty. Those apprehensions were unfounded. “The way they have changed it has been absolutely magnificent,” says former England captain Nasser Hussain. “You would have thought they could not make it any better but they have.”

                                            The pink balls and floodlights in this winter’s Ashes Test will also provide novelty. Then the series moves to Perth, from December 14-18. The golden sunshine, the cracks in the pitch that any fast bowler craves, the sea breeze picking up, the ball flying through to the wicketkeeper, gloves pointing to the azure sky. Perth has a reputation for compelling Test cricket – and the five days there this time are expected to be no different. Ashes to Ashes. The legend continues.

                                                Mike Hussey was born and raised in Perth, and thrived at the WACA in Ashes Tests, scoring 74 and 103 in 2006/07, and 61 and 116 in 2010/11 – both of which led to crushing Australian victories over England. “It is a positive, attacking venue,” he says. “Spectators know they are going to see teams going for it because of the conditions, not the sort of turgid cricket we sometimes get in Tests. It’s also a good ‘seeing’ ground – the light is pure and clean.”

                                                Justin Langer is another Perth boy, who graduated from watching Dennis Lillee and Kim Hughes from the “white picket-fences” to fending off the quicks out in the middle. “Perth is one of the windiest cities in the world,” he says. “The Fremantle Doctor has a tremendous impact. If you’re batting at the Prindiville Stand End when the fast bowler has the sea breeze behind him, you feel tiny. But at the Members End, you feel like a giant. Glenn McGrath always took the end with the wind behind his back. A good swing bowler at the Members End is crucial; Damien Fleming took five wickets in the first innings against England in 1998/99.”

                                                That sensation was perhaps at its most extreme in Langer’s debut series in 1992/93, when the great Antiguan giant Curtly Ambrose wrecked Australia’s batting with an unforgettable spell of seven for one. “The game before at Adelaide we had lost by one run, and I remember seeing [captain] Allan Border distraught after Perth,” says Langer. “He hadn’t beaten West Indies in a series, and I think he realised he never would. After that game I didn’t lose a Test at Perth.”

                                                Fast bowlers have been known to fall into the trap of pitching it too short, so seductive is the bounce. Langer made two big Test hundreds at the WACA – both against Pakistan. “I was at the other end in 1999/2000 when Shoaib Akhtar bowled at Ricky Ponting one of the fastest overs ever recorded [one delivery was clocked at 94mph]. I think we could have taken a single on a few occasions, because the keeper Moin Khan was taking the ball so far back from the stumps. I just leant on my bat and let Ricky take care of it!”

                                                England’s Test record at Perth isn’t rosy, but David Gower remembers one win in 1978/79 fondly (Against an Australia weakened by World Series Cricket defections). He made 102 with what Wisden called “youthful genius”. “I am still very proud of it,” says Gower. “It was my first hundred against Australia, and on my first Ashes tour. Australia may have been weaker overall, but Rodney Hogg was no mug. In short bursts he was as quick as anyone wearing a Baggy Green that I faced.”

                                                England returned the following year, after a truce was signed between Kerry Packer and the cricketing Establishment. The Perth Test was perhaps most memorable for Lillee’s use of an aluminium bat. ”We were hammered, but very cleverly the Ashes were not up for grabs,” smiles Gower.

                                                Gower began the 1982/83 Ashes in a blaze of glory, making a sumptuous 72 before John Dyson took a terrific catch at square-leg. “That was a really flat deck, but with a bit of pace, and my best innings at Perth,” says Gower. “Physically and mentally that was the best I ever felt, so I was disappointed not to go on.”

                                                Four years later, Mike Gatting’s side – famously panned by The Independent’s Martin Johnson as having “only three things wrong with them: they can’t bat, they can’t bowl and they can’t field” – won the Ashes 3-1, though with a draw at Perth (after which England have lost seven straight Tests there). England also memorably won that tour’s Perth one-day Challenge against Australia, West Indies and Pakistan. “A unique tournament,” says Gower. “Winning that gave us a real fillip. We went from no-hopers to winning everything on that trip, and that Perth Challenge was a part of it.”

                                                Gower’s 1990/91 trip is best remembered for him and John Morris hiring a Tiger Moth biplane during a tour match against Queensland. England, led by Graham Gooch, were thumped 3-0 in the Ashes. In the final Test at the WACA, they slumped from 191 for two to 244 all out, with Gower stranded unbeaten on 28. “That tour contained the sublime and the ridiculous. I had some satisfying personal performances but I had my differences with Graham, starting with the Tiger Moth incident. Overall I loved playing at the WACA, and have played some of my best cricket there.”

                                                Perth lads Justin Langer and Mike Hussey both say Cottesloe Beach is the place to go. Midway between Perth and Fremantle, it is easy to reach by car. “It’s beautiful there,” says Hussey. “Head down nice and early and have a swim, then go have a coffee at one of the great cafés down there, like Barchetta. Fremantle is also a wonderful area.” Moore and Moore is an excellent spot for brunch with an on-site art gallery so you can browse eclectic art and vintage furniture while you wait. Or head to Bread in Common, a bakery/restaurant housed in a historic warehouse on Pakenham Street. Langer, now the coach of Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash, says: “Ian Bell and David Willey, the English lads with us at Perth Scorchers, love heading down for brunch on the beach.” David Gower concurs: “Cottesloe is great for beach cafes. From the iconic Indiana Tea House that hovers over the sand to Il Lido for the best coffee in town. Or try the Blue Duck.”

                                                “Hillary’s Boat Harbour, a shopping marina just north of the city, is one of the favourite day trips, especially with our British visitors,” says Langer. “I think our beaches are our best feature in Western Australia… Cottesloe, City, Scarborough.” “If the cricket finishes really early, you can spend a few days down at Margaret River,” says Hussey. “The wine and food are absolutely magnificent – the region is well known for its fresh produce. It’s a three-and-half-hour drive from Perth but it is well worth it.” Hussey also recommends the Swan River valley, a short drive out of central Perth, where wineries have popped up all along the river. There are thought to be 130 species of fish living in the Swan and Canning Rivers.

                                                “The sunset in Perth is phenomenal,” says Langer. “My favourite thing to do after a day’s play was to see the sun set over the Indian Ocean with a beer in hand. You can go anywhere along the coast.” If you have an evening to spare, David Gower recommends catching the suburban train down to Fremantle, the port city just south of Perth. “I have had some good nights out at Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle. It’s fun down there, a lively, vibrant spot. The guys behind this have opened a new spot in central Perth called Petition. Their Beer Corner has 18 independent brews on tap, and a food menu to complement it. There always seems to be a lot going on in Northbridge too. I’ve heard the Mechanics Institute has a roof terrace to soak up the sun and city views.”

                                                Those entasked with updating the glorious Adelaide Oval faced an onerous assignment. Set amid parklands and gardens of fig trees, with its wonderful view of St Peter’s Cathedral and its exquisite, manually operated scoreboard, it was one of the most beautiful grounds in the world. The fact that it is stillone of the most picturesque proves that the architects were successful.

                                                England have fared better there, with its true surface, than at other venues in Australia. They celebrated memorable wins since the Second World War in 1955, 1979, 1995 (that match is credited as the birthplace of the Barmy Army) and 2010.
                                                This winter’s Test at Adelaide, the second in the series, from December 2-6, will be extra special – it will be a day-night clash with pink balls. The epic sunsets famous at the ground promise to be even more spectacular.

                                                “Justin Langer got 179 not out in 1998/99. I remember ‘Bumble’ (coach David Lloyd) having us at the ground two hours before the start in 50 degree heat and we were doing an hour’s warm-up, and half an hour before the first ball the Aussies turned up in shorts and T-shirts, looking at us thinking, ‘mad Englishmen, what are they doing?’ We then spent about two days in the field!”

He won I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! in 2003 but was on the losing England side in the Ashes of 1990/91 and 1994/95 – although he did not lose either of the Tests at the Adelaide Oval.

                                                Speaking on a crowded concourse at Waterloo Station in winter, launching the announcement of the 2017/18 Ashes Series including its day-night Test, he had to use his imagination to recall what Australia was like in their summer.
                                                “Adelaide is a fantastic city,” he said. “A great place to play cricket, and we drew one and won one of my two Tests there, although we lost both series.

                                                “I remember Mark Waugh getting 138 on his debut there [in the fourth Test in 1990/91]. That was also the match that saw David Gower flick to fine-leg just before lunch. Craig McDermott was bowling. We were in a reasonable position (160 for 3 after Australia had scored 386). They moved Merv Hughes onto the short square-leg boundary and David hit a half-volley right down his neck. To say the air went blue would be an understatement. I don’t think David sat near Graham Gooch [the captain] at lunch. There would have been a bit of breathing space.”
                                                A Gooch century helped England draw, but his side lost the series 3-0.
                                                England lost three Tests again four years later, but at least managed one win, at Adelaide. “We had a great party with the Barmy Army after we won, out in the town in Adelaide,” says Tufnell. “I caught Michael Slater off Devon Malcolm. The Barmy Army were just about getting established then, and all the boys came running down that beautiful hill under the scoreboard. Great scene, great memories.

England somehow lost despite declaring their first innings on 551 for 6. “I was thinking, ‘that’s either going to be an England win or a draw on that flat pitch’, but then Shane Warne came along on that last day with his magical spell. England were mesmerised.”
                                                How does Tufnell think the next Ashes will go? “I think it’s going to be tight. England had a rough time in India. We have some great young cricketers – Ben Stokes, Joe Root, Haseeb Hameed and Keaton Jennings.”
                                                The Ashes Test at Adelaide is a special occasion for tourists and Australians alike.

                                            David Gower, the elegant former England batsman, first developed a soft spot for Western Australia as a young cricketer, when he spent four months living in Perth and travelling the length and breadth of the state. He played for Claremont Cottesloe CC in Perth grade cricket, and spent many happy days on Cottesloe Beach, with its “white sand and lovely warm Indian Ocean”.

                                            Gower has been happy to revisit these pleasures on several trips as a player and commentator. “There seem to be a million great places for food in Western Australia,” he says. “Perth is a superb place to eat and drink. They have fantastic seafood. Coco’s in South Perth is a favourite of mine. It has a gorgeous view of the Swan River, where you can watch people sailing and dinghy racing.”

                                            There are plenty of nightlife options springing up in Subiaco, west of the city centre and in front of Kings Park and Botanical Gardens. “Subiaco is a fun place for a night out,” says Mike Hussey, the former Australia batsman, born and raised in Perth. The Subiaco Hotel has a sun-speckled courtyard for lunch or dinner, cocktails in the stylish bar adjacent or Bianca’s Bar for pool tables and live entertainment. Or you could try Juanita’s, a quirky little neighbourhood wine bar on Rokeby Road.

                                            The hardcore cricket fan might want to seek out a Perth club match. Justin Langer – gritty opening batsman in the all-conquering Australia side of the late 1990s and early 2000s – recalls a time when the grade finals were held at the famous WACA ground. “When I was younger the playing area was a lot bigger at the WACA, and they used to play two games of cricket next to each other. You’d quite often see that in Perth. At Scarborough, my club, they play two matches next to each other, and have staged the club final before.”

                                            For many Australians, sampling the local food and drink is a more homespun pleasure. Langer spent his childhood fishing down the coast south of Perth. “My favourite place in all of Australia is Mandurah, because I just have so many happy childhood memories of going down there,” he says. “I learned to fish there when I was young. I have a place down there now. And even now I go fishing or crabbing on a jetty out my backyard. Washed down with a glass of wine or beer – you can’t beat it.”

                                            It is easy to imagine the young Gower on adventurous excursions up and down the coast. Exmouth, 800 miles north of Perth on the North West Cape, is part of the Ningaloo Experience, which includes the superb Ningaloo Reef, famous for its whale sharks and manta rays. “Exmouth has the outstanding Navy Pier dive,” says Gower. “The diving experience is amazing; anyone can do it as the water is not too deep.”

                                            Gower’s crowning moment in Australia was 1986/87, when Mike Gatting’s side swept the Ashes Test series 3-1, and added the one-day Perth Challenge against Australia, West Indies and Pakistan – probably the four strongest one-day teams in the world at the time. Though white-ball cricket was already on the rise, an international cricketer’s itinerary still allowed for a little more downtime.

                                            “During that tour I went on a remarkable rail journey with team-mate Phil Edmonds and Scyld Berry [then cricket correspondent of The Observer],” says Gower. “We left Perth and stopped at Kalgoorlie, a historic city in Western Australia.” Kalgoorlie is the eastern-most stop on the Eastern Goldfields Railway, built in the late 1890s after gold was discovered at Kalgoorlie and hordes of prospectors flocked to the area. From Kalgoorlie the trains make a quick way across the Nullarbor Plain to Adelaide. Visitors can try their hand out panning for gold or seek out the amazing Antony Gormley statues on Lake Ballard.

                                            Justin Langer is proud of Western Australia’s well-earned wine heritage. “In the south of the state we’re blessed with some of the most extraordinary wine regions in the world,” he says. “Dunsborough and Margaret River are particularly rich in variety.” “Brunch is a Perth institution,” advises the former England batsman David Gower, “but come for dinner and you get one of the best views of the sun setting into the Indian Ocean.” Gower has built up an extensive scrapbook of winery visits throughout the state on his many visits. “Leeuwin Estate, in the Margaret River region, is a family-run place which makes a gorgeous drop,” he says. Or just 30 minutes away from Perth, the Swan Valley is home to some of Australia’s oldest vines. “It’s a short drive from Perth, and has some great labels,” he says. “Sandalford is one of the best I have had.” Mike Hussey, the former Australia batsman, has favourite restaurants dotted all over Perth. Stables Bar, in the city centre, was the location of one of Perth’s first stables. Hussey also likes the modern Asian cuisine at Barque, in Fremantle. “And you can’t beat Fraser’s in Kings Park,” he says.

                                            A childhood in Perth meant trips all along the Western Australian coast for the Langer family. The  pearling town of Broome in Australia’s North West is home to the jaw-dropping Cable Beach, often voted one of the best beaches in the world. “Broome is a fascinating place,” says Langer. “It’s about a two-hour flight up there, but a beautiful part of the country. It’s somewhere special.” Australia North West is home to incredible landscapes of burnt red rocks, white sands and turquoise water.

                                            Western Australia has some of the richest flora and fauna in the world. From the picturesque scenery of Rottnest Island, where visitors can snap a picture with the cute quokkas (the island’s photogenic mini marsupials found only here), to an array of aquatic experiences in Australia Coral Coast, including the UNESCO World Heritage listed Ningaloo Reef. “The last time I was in Australia I went to the Ningaloo Reef,” says Gower. “It’s like the Great Barrier Reef, but better. It’s right by the shore rather than two miles out like the Barrier. We stayed at the magnificent Sal Salis resort. The diving and snorkelling were outstanding. Just metres from the shore you can swim with manta rays, turtles and huge shoals of fish.” If time is tight, a trip to Perth Zoo is perfect for the family, says Hussey. “It’s a little ferry ride across the Swan River and a great day out. They also run some important conservation and breeding programmes for native wildlife.”

                                            Any visitor to South Australia is guaranteed to be bowled over by its unbelievable beauty, but the state is also known as the one-stop destination for world-class wine, unbeatable gourmet produce and unique native wildlife. South Australia’s all-round attributes really are incredible.

Luckily, to the east of the City, The Adelaide Hills are marked by unusually cool nights, which go some way to explaining the exceptionally high quality of the wine. “An Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir is pretty amazing,” says Greta. “For example, a glass of Ashton Hills or Ochota Barrels.

Sitting in the midst of Adelaide, yet in a quiet lane with leafy trees and vines - fabulous.”

But having said that, the Crafers Inn in Adelaide Hills has been refurbished in the last few years and is brilliant for a gastronomic delight and a bottle of something special from their wine cellar. It’s great for special celebrations but equally good for an impromptu get together.”

You pick up a cheese hamper and it comes with a map to wineries along the trail, then you drop in and they give (yes – give!) you a glass of wine that is coordinated with one of the cheeses in your hamper. It's a great way of getting to some of the wineries in McLaren Vale too – and the views are spectacular.”

For those who like a day’s hike, head to Waterfall Gully and climb up to Mount Lofty Summit to take in the view. There is a fab café and restaurant at the summit so you can grab a bite while you are there, or do what my dad and I do on occasion, and wait until you reach the waterfall at the bottom again and head to the quaint and super-friendly tea rooms and restaurant for a bowl of the best soup around.​”
